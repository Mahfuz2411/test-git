1. What is Git & Github?
  Git: Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and independently, without interfering with each other's work. It provides features such as branching, merging, and distributed workflows, which enable efficient collaboration and code management.

  GitHub: GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built on top of Git that provides hosting for Git repositories and additional collaboration features. It was launched in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular platforms for open-source projects, as well as for private repositories used by individuals and organizations.

2. What is VCS?
  VCS stands for Version Control System. It is a software tool used in software development to manage changes to source code over time. A VCS tracks revisions, modifications, and versions of files and directories, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently.

3. What is Repository?
  In the context of version control systems (VCS) like Git, a repository (often abbreviated as "repo") is a central location where data and files are stored, managed, and tracked. It serves as a container for the entire history of a project, including all of its files, directories, and their revisions.

4. What is terminal/powershel?
  A terminal, often referred to as a command-line interface (CLI), is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system or execute commands on a computer. It provides users with a way to input text commands to perform various tasks, such as navigating the file system, running programs, managing files, and configuring system settings.

  PowerShell, specifically, is a powerful command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It is designed for task automation and configuration management in the Windows operating system environment. PowerShell provides a command-line interface similar to traditional shells like Command Prompt (cmd.exe), but with enhanced capabilities, including access to .NET Framework and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for managing Windows systems.
